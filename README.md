# A/C Simulation

## Concept Description
The plan for this project is to simulate an A/C System. The first version will include a digital recreation of a thermostat with the same functionality and logic as a real thermostat.
The end goal of this project is to integrate and simulate condensors and air handlers into the system that are controlled via the thermostat. I plan on being able to show what is happening real time in a system. This project has the potential to simulate various components at different levels of complexity. Electrical simulation would also be a big achievement to stride towards.
